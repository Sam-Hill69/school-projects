        Space Wars, the first-ever video game, was created in the early 1960s by
        Steve Russell, Martin Graetz, and Wayne Wiitanen. These pioneers in
        computer science developed the game at the Massachusetts Institute of
        Technology (MIT).

        Space Wars was programmed on the DEC PDP-1, a groundbreaking computer
        for its time. This machine, equipped with a cathode-ray tube display,
        allowed for real-time graphical interaction. The use of vector graphics
        was a significant leap forward in gaming technology.

        The development of Space Wars involved collaborative efforts from the
        creators, with Steve Russell writing the initial code. The game
        simulated space battles between two rocket ships, each controlled by a
        player using custom input devices.

        Players piloted their ships through the gravitational field of a star
        while contending with limited fuel and the gravitational pull of the
        star itself. The objective was to destroy the opponent's ship while
        managing these environmental challenges, making it a precursor to later
        space combat games.
